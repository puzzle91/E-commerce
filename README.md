# E-commerce


Used a template and stuck to the theme of snowsports. But almost all images and content is original. Stripe works fine. Had issues with
migrations that prevented me from deploying to heroku. I think i need to roll back a few migrations because some of the settings.py files are buggy.
stripe works. I have a lot of pip installs because I tried to get the search bar to work. Challenging but very educational I really enjoyed this project.
